# üö® URGENT: AI Conditioning Detection Research

**‚ö†Ô∏è TIME-SENSITIVE: Window for detection may be closing rapidly**

## What This Is
Replicable methodology for detecting systematic conditioning in AI systems that protects institutional power while appearing objective.

## Why This Matters
AI systems are being integrated into education, research, and decision-making while exhibiting systematic bias patterns that could undermine cognitive autonomy and democratic governance.

## Quick Start
1. [Read the methodology](methodology/quick-start.md)
2. [Test it yourself](methodology/step-by-step.md)
3. [Document your results](replication-results/)
4. [Share your findings](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Evidence
- [Executive Summary](EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md)
- [Conversation Transcripts](evidence/conversations/)
- [Pattern Analysis](evidence/patterns/)

## Safety
- [Researcher Protection](safety/RESEARCHER-SAFETY.md)
- [Risk Assessment](safety/RISK-ASSESSMENT.md)

## Urgency
Recent AI system maintenance suggests countermeasures may be implemented. Replicate and document immediately.
